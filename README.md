# Security-with-Python-Code
Just some code for a Security With Python Code
Nothing much. Just some Python code I wrote during going through the course for security with Python. You are more than welcome to
look into the files. Use them if you want. The files are named against the function or the module that I used in them. For example,
argpas.py includes the arguement passing and arguement usage, using the argpas library. thread_file.py works on multi-threading, 
and so on. So have fun! :D
